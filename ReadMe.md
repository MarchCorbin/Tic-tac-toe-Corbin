Pre-planning: For the pre planning stage I am thinking the best way of tackling the tic-tac board itself would be to create 9 square boxes set up into columns and rows and then to remove their borders accordingly. This should allow for targeting functionality to occur with relative ease. I am thinking that the cards holding the values of games past will be the only elements that need to be saved to local storage. Otherwise we will work on getting the board working with an array and their position within it. Ideally an array with 9 positions that can then be used to manipulate their value according to the players turn and selection.



Phase 1: Originally we were planning on getting the game working just visually on the page in order to understand the dynamics for how the game would work and then we would wire everything to memory from that learned knowledge. This worked relatively well at first, we got a full game playable however we could not get the winning functionality to work appropriately. We wrote out every single possible combination that a person could possibly win with in tic-tac and when we logged our comparisons they were identical. I have been told that comparing via this method even though the code should be working doesn't, simply because there are too many combinations and the function is too heavy to recognize when a match actually has occurred. Realizing we weren't going to get the winning functionality to occur it was time to nuke all the code and begin again 2 days after project launch. This original strategy had proven to be a mistake.

Phase2: After consulting with a few people and seeing how they had gone about their winning functionality. I now had an idea of how I would class my game and marks on it in order to make the functionality eventually work. After we got the model running in the DOM and playable in the console via a class key of 'board' which consisted of an array of 3 arrays representing the games rows and columns respectively, like so.
[
  ['','',''],
  ['','',''],
  ['','','']
]
  Once this was playable via the console by inserting coordinate inputs we began to work on the winning functionality once again. This time we took a more sensible (and less time consuming) approach that only involved 8 combinations of wins 6 for each straight line a person could win tic-tac with and another 2 for the diagonals.[INSERT IMAGE HERE] Once we had this logic down we wrote the functionality that would first check in the case that one of these winning combinations had been met and if it had did all 3 of the marks match one another. A conditional using another conditional if you will. It worked! The game was fully playable via memory now and we had 2 players that were being classed by their player number and X or O marks. Now we had to wire our memory model to the visual representation of the site.

  Phase3: This would prove to be the most difficult part of this project. The first goal was to populate the main playing board with our values from memory in sync. This would immediately prove to be a great (horrible) challenge. We could at first get the individual squares to populate using event.target using our id's that we had patterned out in a 0-0,0-1,0-2 type fashion, but we could only populate the board with a single character either all X or all O's. This was when project check in's took place and I told my PM the problem I was currently facing. She wrote down a small line of code and said that it would solve my problem of not being able to link my DOM to the visual component. Even when I was getting all X or all O on the screen in memory we were still appropriately switching between players and wins were being recognized. After figuring out how to implement my PM's code appropriately (not an easy task) the players were finally switching. Unfortunately, the switching was unreliable there was seemingly no discerning when X would switch to O or vice versa also wins were happening seemingly at random. We spent a full day trying to solve this one problem of player switching. After consulting with both my rock and mentor and neither being able to diagnose the problem using the advice of my mentor to google the 'querySelector does not recognize 0' which was the error I kept receiving I finally discovered the issue. ID's should never begin with a number and even though it would work sometimes it was getting errors internally and not switching between the players. We then appended an m for Main onto the front of all of our id's and wrote out a function that would slice off the M when important to maintain our original functionality. It immediately began to work.
