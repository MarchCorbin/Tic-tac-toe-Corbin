Pre-planning: For the pre planning stage I am thinking the best way of tackling the tic-tac board itself would be to create 9 square boxes set up into columns and rows and then to remove their borders accordingly. This should allow for targeting functionality to occur with relative ease. I am thinking that the cards holding the values of games past will be the only elements that need to be saved to local storage. Otherwise we will work on getting the board working with an array and their position within it. Ideally an array with 9 positions that can then be used to manipulate their value according to the players turn and selection.
